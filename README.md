# Compact Action Bar

**Compact Action Bar** reduces the amount of space occupied by your action bar, maintaining the original World of Warcraft style. The bottom left and bottom right bars are stacked one above the other. Buttons and bags are hidden by default and can be switched to by hitting the toggle button or Ctrl + Space (editable) shortcut.

The addon includes some additional customization options and a few presets to choose from to match your liking. Right vertical bars can be stacked additionally, on top of the existing bars.
